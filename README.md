# LEOPARDTrainings
This app is to support physiotherapy/mobillity training with "Become Supple Leopard" book by Kelly Starrett

This app will allow you to create your own training plans and routines to exercise with the book and focus on body parts that require most attention.
This app will use the same terms and names as in the book. All trainings will be based on the body map in the book and organized the same way.
It will be very useful for the people that like to have nice tracking system of their mobillity trainings.
